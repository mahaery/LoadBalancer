# Simple Load Balancer Library

## Overview

This repository houses a simple load balancer library that efficiently handles resources in a distributed environment. The project was created during a live coding session to showcase the development of a basic load balancing solution.

## Features

- **Resource Management**: The load balancer effectively manages and distributes resources across different nodes in a distributed system.

- **Load Balancing Algorithm**: Implements a basic load balancing algorithm to evenly distribute the workload among available nodes.

- **Unit Tests**: The codebase includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the load balancer functionality.

## Usage

To integrate the load balancer into your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/load-balancer-library.git
    ```

2. Include the load balancer library in your project.

3. Initialize the load balancer with your resources and start distributing the workload.

```csharp
// Example code snippet
LoadBalancer loadBalancer = new LoadBalancer();
loadBalancer.AddResource(new Node("Node1"));
loadBalancer.AddResource(new Node("Node2"));
loadBalancer.AddResource(new Node("Node3"));

// Request next resource from load balancer
Resource resource = loadBalancer.Next();
```

## Unit Tests
The repository includes a robust set of unit tests to validate the functionality of the load balancer. These tests cover various scenarios, ensuring the load balancer behaves as expected under different conditions.

To run the unit tests, use your preferred testing framework and execute the test suite.

## Contributions
Contributions to improve the load balancer library are welcome. If you identify issues, have suggestions, or want to add features, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

Feel free to explore the codebase, experiment with the load balancer, and contribute to its enhancement.
